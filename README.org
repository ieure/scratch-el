  This project [[https://codeberg.org/emacs-weirdware/scratch][has moved to Codeberg]], and the GitHub history has been
  wiped and replaced with this README.

  GitHub cannot be trusted.  Their proprietary CoPilot feature is
  trained on free software and violates the terms of their licensing
  at massive scale.  Any code uploaded to GitHub will be laundered
  through ML models and into commercial software.
